About
-----
MeghOS-Portfolio is designed to feel like a developer's workstation â€” minimal, keyboard-first, and information-dense. It's ideal for demonstrating:
- System automation and scripting
- Infrastructure-as-code examples
- Monitoring and reliability workflows
- Linux proficiency and troubleshooting notes

Features
--------
- Terminal-inspired UI with choice of light/dark themes
- Project gallery for DevOps and SRE-focused work
- Resume / skills section emphasizing Linux, CI/CD, observability, and cloud tooling
- Config snippets and downloadable dotfiles / playbooks
- Responsive layout with keyboard navigation hints

Tech stack
----------
- Primary: TypeScript (frontend + tooling) â€” ~97% of repo
- Styling: CSS
- Other: Static assets and build utilities

Getting started
---------------
Clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/MeghVyas3132/MeghOS-Portfolio.git
cd MeghOS-Portfolio

# install
npm install

# run in dev mode
npm run dev

# build
npm run build
npm run start
```

Usage notes
-----------
- Keyboard-first navigation: use Tab/Arrow keys to move between sections.
- Content is structured to be copy-paste friendly â€” configuration snippets are provided as ready-to-use code blocks.
- Replace placeholder screenshots in /assets with your own for personalization.

Development
-----------
- Code is TypeScript-first. Keep typings strict and prefer small, focused components.
- Linting & formatting:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```
- Tests (if added):
```bash
npm test
```

Accessibility & Performance
-------------------------
- Aim for semantic HTML and good contrast for terminal vibes without sacrificing accessibility.
- Optimize images in /assets; prefer SVG for icons and terminal ornaments.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome â€” whether it's a fix, feature, or design polish. A few guidelines:
- Open an issue describing the change first if it's non-trivial.
- Keep PRs focused and include screenshots / GIFs for UI changes.
- Follow the existing code style and ensure TypeScript types are updated when changing interfaces.

Suggested checklist for PRs:
- [ ] Local build succeeds (npm run build)
- [ ] Linting and formatting applied
- [ ] New dependencies justified and minimal
- [ ] Screenshots updated if UI changed
